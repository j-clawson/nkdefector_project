# North Korean Defector Project

This personal project utilizes **Transact-SQL**, **Microsoft SQL Server**, and **Python** to analyze trends exhibited by North Korean defectors in relation to their lifestyle. The goal is to explore various factors influencing their adaptation and integration into a new environment, namely in areas such as education, employment, background, and residence. The analysis includes a historical tracking of refugees presiding in countries other than South Korea.

Data was collected from the websites of the Ministry of Unification (www.unikorea.go.kr) and the United Nations Refugee Agency (www.unchr.org).
The data collection process involved storing tables in **Microsoft Excel**, which were then imported into a locally hosted database on Microsoft SQL Server. This ensured efficient organization and manipulation for further analysis in Python.
