# North Korean Defector Project

This personal project utilizes **SQL** and **Python** to analyze trends exhibited by North Korean defectors in relation to their lifestyle. The goal is to explore various factors influencing their adaptation and integration into a new environment, namely in areas such as education, employment, background, and residence. The analysis includes a historical tracking of refugees presiding in countries other than South Korea. 

Data was collected from the websites of the Ministry of Unification (www.unikorea.go.kr) and the United Nations Refugee Agency (www.unchr.org).
